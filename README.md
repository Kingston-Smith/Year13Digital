# Year13Digital
 
During development, I did temporaily have to code on github instead of VSC starting on the 5th of may, 2025, thats why the commits were so think then.
I realised that my bug fixing document isn't updating, it does exist, it's just not on here properly
Had to continue coding in a new folder on the computer because the computers got moved around during bedwars and this was the fastest way I could find to continue coding.
My client, speak22, has requested that I do not do the css or inputing of information, because they wish to do it themselves at a later date
